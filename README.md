# malloc
Implementation of `malloc` library (`malloc`, `free`, etc.) made for Computer Systems course at University of Wroc≈Çaw.

It utilises linked lists of arenas consisting of memory pages acquried through syscalls.
Arenas are divided between chunks of size atleast of a biggest hardware word (effectively equal to `2*sizeof(void *)`),
which are then returned to user.

Feel free to run any app using my malloc via this command: 
`LD_PRELOAD=./malloc.so xeyes`

## Requirements:
* gcc
* Make
* pkg-config
